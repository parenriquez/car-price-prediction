Inside the [car_price_prediction](./car_price_prediction.ipynb) notebook, we would explore a used car prices dataset which includes numerical and categorical variables, prepare and clean our data, and use linear regression to predict the price for a used car. 

We will explore how Linear Regression is implemented in its Normal Form by matrix manipulation. We will also explore what Regularization is and why it is necessary, but we will also implement it from scratch.

Data can be found at the [data](./data) folder.
